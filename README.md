i317 Projects

## Before you start
- Make sure you don't have spaces in your path. Venv has a hard time dealing with spaces in the path.
- Set up a folder where you're going to put the project, this is not the folder that will contain the code, its the folder that will contain the folder with the code in it.
- Set up a new virtual environment in this folder.
- Acitvate your venv, thats `. venv/bin/activate` in a UNIX command line. It's different for Windows.'
- Clone this repository into this folder and navigate to it.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the packages we are using.

At the end of this you should have a structure like the following: 

Containing folder:
- venv folder
- project folder

## To run

- Activate the venv
- Run `python samply.py` to launch the app.
- Put the IP address in to a browser to see it in action.
